# News Auth Application
In this application the user can search a news topic and recieve articles.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express Framework of choice

In this application I used a API to grab news articles based on what the user types in. The user then can save any articles they find interesting to their profile.



## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use someone else's API and then take the information I recieved from that API into my DB.
